                    <h2>The only constant in life is change</h2>

                    <p>I was born in Castelfranco Veneto in 1998. I've always been passionate about technology. When I
                        was little, my parents used to buy manuals that came with the newspaper to learn how to use Word
                        and Excel, and I would study them all. A fun pastime, right? As I grew up, I decided to follow
                        this passion by enrolling in the technical institute in my city, majoring in computer science
                        and telecommunications. At this point, you might think that's the end of the story, right? He
                        graduates and starts working at an IT company, or at most, goes to university to continue his
                        studies in this field.
                    </p>

                    <p class="e-invece-no">
                        <strong>THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>I did, actually, go to university, but to study Chinese. First plot twist of this story. I made
                        the decision in the last year of high school, I like to say following a trip to Stockholm with
                        some friends. There I realized that I would be missing out on an opportunity if I didn't go to
                        university. Moreover, I felt the need to completely change my field of study. And here I am in
                        August 2017. Venice, a blank sheet of paper and a pen in hand, ready to take the entrance
                        exam for the three-year degree course in Language, Culture, and Society of Asia and
                        Mediterranean Africa. Many times I found myself thinking, "Who made me do it?" But the
                        answers will come later, don't worry. Everything will make sense.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once I decide to do something, I have to do it well. So, I applied for the double degree program
                        with Capital Normal University in Beijing. I passed. In August 2019, I said goodbye to Italy and
                        found myself in one of the largest megacities in the world. The goal was to stay there for two
                        years
                        and obtain a double degree. I did get the double degree, but things didn't go as planned.
                        expected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In December 2019, I pack my bags and prepare to return to Italy for the winter holidays."See you
                        in February," I said to some friends.
                    </p>

                    <p class="e-invece-no">
                        <strong>THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "I land in Italy (with a fever of 40, by the way). The day after, the beginning of the Covid-19
                        pandemic is declared in China, and with it, the hopes of returning to China are reduced to zero.
                        After an initial moment of confusion, we eventually receive instructions to continue the project
                        online. Unfortunately, online, for those of us in Italy, meant having classes at night. And so
                        it was, for a year and a half, the school bell rang at 2:30 in the night, lessons all night
                        long, until morning light. If I could go back, I wouldn't do it again, but I did it, and it
                        didn't even
                        felt too hard to do. After all, you couldn't go anywhere except home during that time."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After completing the two degrees, I decide to further my education with a master's degree in
                        economics from the same department, with a blend of linguistic and managerial skills. This time,
                        I attended classes in person, in Venice. I delved deeper into the Chinese language and ventured
                        into the world of business management, learning terms like "horizontal structure," "activities,"
                        and "call-option".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once I've graduated, it's all said and done, right? I'll be joining a company "that deals with
                        China" (like all the people surrounding me used to said) and travel
                        the world doing sales and talking to the business people from the red dragon.
                    </p>

                    <p class="e-invece-no">
                        <strong>THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thanks to the career service of the university, I found an opportunity at a well-known insurance
                        agency in my area. I
                        interviewed. They hired me. I start gaining my first experiences in the working world,
                        understanding how an office is structured, how a commercial initiative is carried out, and much
                        more. After 6 months, I take on the role of project manager in the field of wealth management
                        consulting and begin to create a consistent and coherent proposal for the agency's clients.
                        Well, you might say, he's found his path, he'll continue in this sector, and everyone lived
                        happily ever after.
                    </p>

                    <p class="e-invece-no">
                        <strong>THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT. (this is the last one, I swear)</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I decide to leave that path behind, aware of the lessons learned and with the determination to
                        make a difference in the world of the future. And what better choice than to return to where
                        this whole story began. To the digital world. I start a master's program with start2impact
                        university in blockchain development, curious to understand how this new technology works and
                        how it can be applied in the real world. I've just started, but I can already see that the
                        master's program not only prepares you to develop applications on the blockchain but also
                        provides you with context and equips you with the tools to navigate this intricate and complex
                        world with agility.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And this website is a testament to that. It was created entirely by me as part of the HTML & CSS
                        course.
                    </p>

                    <p class="e-invece-no">
                        <strong>THAT'S NOT... just kidding, the story ends here. (for now)</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My journey so far has been varied, unpredictable, without (seemingly) a coherent logic. But
                        that's precisely what's beautiful about it. I find myself having skills (like linguistic ones)
                        that I wouldn't have had if I had followed a static path in the world of computer science from
                        the beginning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you've read this far, I thank you. I hope that my story can be an inspiration to other young
                        people who don't have a clear idea of what they want to become when they grow up. Because one
                        thing I've learned is that many of these 'grown-ups' have a lot to learn from us young people,
                        and not just the other way around.
                    </p>
